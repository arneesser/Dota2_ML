# Dota2_ML
This mini project investigated the research question: Can we accurately predict the outcome of dota matches after 15 minutes of gameplay based off of team networth, xp gain, and lasthits alone? Dota 2 is a multiplayer online battle arena (MOBA) video game in which two teams of five players compete to collectively destroy a large structure defended by the opposing team known as the "Ancient", whilst defending their own. Several ML models were used to predict the outcome of the matches including: random forest, support vector machines (SVM), and logistic regression. The best models were found to achieve an F-1 score of 0.70 demonstrating that the suggested features do predict match outcome to a certain extent. However, there is certainly room for more features that could improve the performance of the model such as the heroes played, items bought and more.
