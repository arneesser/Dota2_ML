# Dota2_ML
This mini project investigated the research question: Can we accurately predict the outcome of dota matches after 15 minutes of gameplay based off of team networth, xp gain, and last-hits alone? 

Dota 2 is a multiplayer online battle arena (MOBA) video game in which two teams of five players compete to collectively destroy a large structure defended by the opposing team known as the "Ancient", whilst defending their own. The dataset used is availalble on Kaggle at: https://www.kaggle.com/devinanzelmo/dota-2-matches?rvi=1

Several ML models were used to predict the outcome of the matches including: random forest, support vector machines (SVM), and logistic regression. The best models were found to achieve an F-1 score of 0.70 demonstrating that the nominated features do accurately predict match outcomes to a certain extent. Despite that, there is certainly room for more features that could improve the performance of the model such as the heroes played, items bought and more.
