# Dota2_ML
This mini project investigated a personally curious research question: Can we accurately predict the outcome of dota matches after 15 minutes of gameplay based off of team networth, experience (xp) gain, and last-hits alone? 

Dota 2 is a multiplayer online battle arena (MOBA) video game in which two teams of five players compete to collectively destroy a large structure defended by the opposing team known as the "Ancient", whilst defending their own. The dataset used is available on Kaggle at: https://www.kaggle.com/devinanzelmo/dota-2-matches?rvi=1

EDA results showed that one of two sides wins 51.9% of the time. So the base case (constantly predicting Radiant Win) has indeed 51.9% precision. Several ML models were used to predict the outcome of the matches including: random forest, support vector machines (SVM), and logistic regression. The best models were found to achieve an F-1 score of 0.70 demonstrating that the nominated features do accurately predict match outcomes to a certain extent. Despite that, there is certainly room for more features that could improve the performance of the model which were not accounted for such as the heroes played, items bought, towers destroyed and more. 

Feature importance extracted from logistic regression revealed that networth was most pertinent in predicting winrate, followed by xp. Interestingly, last-hits had a marginally negative co-efficient suggesting that its effect size towards predicting winrate at the 15 minute mark is not meaningful.
